## Hi everyone
 this will be my first coding project actually i wouldn't even call it a project this are just random pieces of code that i am learning in my tutorial and practising on my own.

 I decided to put everything on github so it stays as a record of how far i have a come in learning and so i can assess myself better.
 
 Started with html and css currently focusing on these two after understanding them to some extent gonna start with javascript.
 
 t's not like this is my first time learning/doing code i have done all the basics of java , python , c++.Yes!! you read it right just the "Basics" and haven't really completed a single language to it's entirety....But now i have decided that i am gonna finish this thing till the end and with complete honesty.
